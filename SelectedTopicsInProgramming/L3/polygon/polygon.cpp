/**
 * TODO: 1) Very important: fix the memory leak. Address sanitizer may help (add -DASAN=ON to cmake in Linux).
 * TODO: 2) Change the initializations to uniform initializations with curly braces.
 *          Be careful, not all make sense.
 * TODO: 3) move-constructor and move-assignment operator have identical code, DONE
 *          which is difficult to maintain. How can we apply the DRY principle? Fix it!
 *          DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself, i.e. get rid of the code duplicates by reusing the code.
 * TODO: 4) copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator have almost identical code, DONE
 *          which is difficult to maintain. How can we apply the DRY principle? Fix it!
 * TODO: 5) Nearly all constructors have identical initializations, DRY them by using constructor delegation.
 * TODO: 6) Use std::copy instead of for() loop when copying array data. DONE
 * TODO: 7) Compare the performance of copy-assignment vs move-assignment (mentally).
 * TODO: 8) Install SonarLink plugin for Clion (Settings -> Plugins -> search for SonarLint,
 *          click install, restart) and check if there are more issues in this file and polygon.hpp.

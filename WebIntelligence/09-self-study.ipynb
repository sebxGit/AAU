    "## Tasks\n",
    "In this task you are expected to collect some RDF graphs from web and merge them into a local RDF graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use RDF graphs from DBLP, a web site describing bibliographic data about scientific article in computer science. Each researcher has an associated DBLP person ID. For example, the person ID of Daniele is 57/8026. The code can be used to create Daniele's IRI: [http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026](http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026). Starting from here, it is possible to access different representations of the resource by adding a file extension. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By adding \".html\", one can access the HTML page describing Daniele: [http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.html](http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.html)\n",
    "* By adding \".rdf\", one can access the XML/RDF page describing Daniele: [http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.rdf](http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.rdf)\n",
    "* By adding \".ttl\", one can access the Turtle page describing Daniele: [http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.ttl](http://dblp.org/pid/57/8026.ttl)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "The code below constructs a simple crawler to start from a person and collect all articles written by that person or their coauthors (i.e., only using two types of links: authorOf and coCreatorWith). To fulfill the task you should extend it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select about 5 teachers or project supervisors you have worked with. \n",
    "* Identify their DBLP personal identifiers, and consequently their IRIs.\n",
    "* Collect the RDF describing them and combine them in a RDF graph\n",
    "* Analyse the graph (i.e. iterate over the graph and check its content) to answer the following questions:\n",
    "    * How many articles have they authored?\n",
    "    * Who is the person who co-authored with more people?\n",
    "    * What are their Google Scholar IDs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "Starting from the IRIs of the people you used in Task 1, create a co-author network, i.e., a graph describing who wrote papers with whom. In this graph, the nodes represent people, and the edges indicate that the two nodes wrote an article together. Create this graph as a knowledge graph, using the Graph class from RDFLib. \n",
    "\n",
    "In detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the profiles you used in Task 1 as seeds, and collect their RDF graphs.\n",
    "* Populate the co-author network with the information about the co-authorships. For each author, store its IRI and the Literal with the name of the author.\n",
    "* Develop a strategy to decide the next person to crawl.\n",
    "* Stop when the co-authors network contains ca. 1000 authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code snippets\n",
    "Feel free to reuse the following code to solve the above tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function retrieves a graph from DBLP, given the IRI."
